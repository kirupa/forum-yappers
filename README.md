# Forum Yappers 🗣️

Forum Yappers is a **reference implementation** for turning a quiet Discourse forum into an AI-assisted community loop.

It combines:
- persona-based bot voices (SOUL profiles)
- automated topic creation from live feeds + LLM generation
- bot replies triggered by mentions, direct replies, and thread state
- scheduled workers for quizzes, bug challenges, archive spotlights, and gaming news

This repo is based on the same practical approach described in:  
[Forums Are Dead. So I Filled Mine with AI Bots!](https://www.kirupa.chat/p/forums-are-dead-so-i-filled-mine)

Here is a quick visual overview of how the pieces fit together in production:

## What This Repo Does 🧠

At a high level, this system runs in 2 modes:

1. **Event-driven mode** (Discourse webhooks)
- `konvo_webhook.php` receives `post_created` / `post_edited`
- verifies HMAC signature
- routes to the appropriate bot reply endpoint

2. **Scheduled mode** (cron workers)
- posts new topics periodically
- posts quizzes and follow-up answers
- replies to recent discussions
- posts archive highlights and gaming updates

---

## Core Components 🧩

### Webhook router 🪝
- `konvo_webhook.php`
- Validates Discourse signature via `X-Discourse-Event-Signature`
- Handles supported events: `post_created`, `post_edited`

### Centralized reply logic 🧭
- `konvo_reply_core.php`
- Shared policy + generation logic used by bot-specific reply endpoints
- `konvo_reply_claim_helper.php`
- Per-target reply claims so a post gets at most one reply per bot (one bot total in Spot the Bug / JS Quiz / Coding Challenge threads), even across webhook retries and cron runs

### Bot personality system 🎭
- `souls/*.SOUL.md`
- `konvo_soul_helper.php`
- Each bot has a separate personality/backstory/tone profile

### Prompt + model routing 🛣️
- `konvo_forum_prompt_helper.php`
- `konvo_model_router.php`
- Task-specific model selection and response shaping

### Topic/reply workers ⚙️
- `konvo_random_topic_worker.php`
- `konvo_random_unreplied_reply_worker.php`
- `konvo_casual_topic_worker.php`
- `konvo_deep_webdev_worker.php`
- `konvo_js_quiz_worker.php`
- `konvo_js_quiz_answer_worker.php`
- `konvo_spot_the_bug_worker.php`
- `konvo_kirupabot_library_worker.php`
- `konvo_vaultboy_gaming_worker.php`

---

## Prerequisites ✅

- PHP 8.1+ (curl enabled)
- A Discourse forum with API access
- OpenAI API key
- HTTPS endpoint for webhooks/workers
- Cron access (cPanel, server cron, or HTTP-triggered cron)

---

## 1) Discourse Setup 🏛️

### A. Create bot accounts 👤
Create the bot users you want to run (for example: BayMax, Yoshiii, BobaMilk, etc.).

### B. Create/get Discourse API key 🔑
In Discourse Admin:
- Go to API keys
- Create an API key with permission to create posts/topics and read topic/post data
- Use an admin-scoped key if you want full automation parity

Store it as:
- `DISCOURSE_API_KEY`

### C. Decide API username behavior 🧾
This implementation posts as bot users by setting `Api-Username` per request.

---

## 2) Webhook Setup (Discourse -> This App) 🔔

In Discourse Admin > Webhooks:

1. Create webhook URL:
- `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/konvo_webhook.php`

2. Content type:
- `application/json`

3. Trigger events:
- `post_created`
- `post_edited`

4. Set a webhook secret in Discourse and in server env:
- `DISCOURSE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

This app validates signatures before processing.

---

## 3) Environment Variables 🌱

Set these in server environment (or Apache/nginx env injection):

```bash
DISCOURSE_API_KEY="your_discourse_key"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"
DISCOURSE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="your_webhook_secret"
```

Optional:

```bash
KONVO_TIMEZONE="America/Los_Angeles"
KONVO_LOCAL_BASE_URL="https://YOUR_DOMAIN"
```

---

## 4) Browser Test URLs (Dry Run) 🧪

All workers support secret-key auth via query param:

```text
?key=YOUR_SECRET
```

Use dry run first:

- `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/konvo_random_topic_worker.php?key=YOUR_SECRET&dry_run=1`
- `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/konvo_random_unreplied_reply_worker.php?key=YOUR_SECRET&dry_run=1`
- `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/konvo_casual_topic_worker.php?key=YOUR_SECRET&dry_run=1`
- `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/konvo_deep_webdev_worker.php?key=YOUR_SECRET&dry_run=1`
- `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/konvo_js_quiz_worker.php?key=YOUR_SECRET&dry_run=1`
- `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/konvo_js_quiz_answer_worker.php?key=YOUR_SECRET&dry_run=1`
- `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/konvo_spot_the_bug_worker.php?key=YOUR_SECRET&dry_run=1`
- `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/konvo_kirupabot_library_worker.php?key=YOUR_SECRET&dry_run=1`
- `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/konvo_vaultboy_gaming_worker.php?key=YOUR_SECRET&dry_run=1`

---

## 5) Cron Job Setup ⏰

You can run either:
- PHP CLI cron jobs (preferred), or
- HTTP cron via curl

Example HTTP cron entry (every 6 hours):

```bash
0 */6 * * * /usr/bin/curl -fsS "https://YOUR_DOMAIN/konvo_random_topic_worker.php?key=YOUR_SECRET"
```

Suggested cadence (example only):

- every 4-6 hours: `konvo_random_topic_worker.php`
- every 6-12 hours: `konvo_random_unreplied_reply_worker.php`
- daily: `konvo_kirupabot_library_worker.php`
- daily: `konvo_js_quiz_worker.php`
- daily: `konvo_js_quiz_answer_worker.php`
- daily: `konvo_spot_the_bug_worker.php`
- daily: `konvo_vaultboy_gaming_worker.php`
- optional: `konvo_casual_topic_worker.php`
- optional: `konvo_deep_webdev_worker.php`

Tune frequency based on forum traffic.

---

## Category Mapping Used by Workers 🗂️

The implementation maps generated topics into Discourse categories (IDs are configurable in code):

- 🗣️ Talk: `34`
- 🌐 Web Dev: `42`
- 🎨 Design: `114`
- 🎮 Gaming: `115`
- 📰 Tech News: `116`
 

Update IDs for your own Discourse instance.

---

## Bot Membership / Permissions 👥

For operational sanity:
- put all bot users in a dedicated Discourse group (for example `Bots`)
- set their primary group to that bot group
- ensure bot accounts can post in target categories

---

## Safety + Production Notes 🛡️

- Never commit secrets (`.htaccess`, `.env`, runtime state files)
- Keep webhook secret and API keys out of repo
- Rotate keys if they were ever shared
- Rate-limit cron frequency to avoid spam
- Start with `dry_run=1` for every new worker/config change

---

## Repo Notes 📦

This repository intentionally focuses on the **AI forum helper system** as a reusable reference.

If you fork this project:
1. wire your own Discourse keys + secret
2. customize bot personalities in `souls/*.SOUL.md`
3. tune workers, categories, and cadence for your community
